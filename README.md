# Christian Action Canvas :rocket:

### Directions :flashlight:

- Go to the LMS and follow the guide:
[Canvas Introduction](https://learn.xccelerate.co/unit/view/id:6042)
[Canvas Capture Mouse Events](https://learn.xccelerate.co/unit/view/id:6043)
[Canvas: Online Paint](https://learn.xccelerate.co/unit/view/id:6045)

#### Tip:

Try removing lines of code to see how it works together. Go slow, and read the documentation. Also, looking at different examples online might be helpful!

#### Examples:

- the-canvas-boys.surge.sh
- http://canvasg2march.surge.sh/

### How to run this package

- Make sure you clone the repository

- Double click on index.html

### How it works :open_book:

### Day 16 Introduction to canvas

Open the Canvas_Introduction directory

In the index.html follow the instructions and practice using Canvas through scripting

### Day 17 Introduction to canvas

Open the Canvas_Mouse_Events directory

In Example One follow the LMs and try to see if you can capture and use mouse events
In this example there is only one canvas

In Example Two check to see how the classes and scripts operate, add console.log statements to see the flow of the classes
In this example there are two canvas's allowing for us to capture mouse events and generate variety of dynamic shapes
Additionally this example has been modularised so that we can have better directory / file structure
Use the console to change shape and draw them in your browser
Also try to change the color of the rectangles and the thickness of the lines. 

### Day 18 Introduction to canvas

Open the Canvas_Boilerplate directory

Run the index.html using live server and test out the current functionalities
Create new strategy patterns and add them into this canvas application
Try to adhere to the folder structure here

In the javascript folder, there are various functionalities for the canvas application (please implement more, here)

- javascript
  - canvas-common.js
  - drawing-line.js
  - drawing-rectangle.js
- css
  - style.css
